# iOS DSA Problems

## 📌 Purpose
This repository is dedicated to solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems in Swift**, particularly for **iOS developers preparing for coding interviews**. Many iOS developers struggle with DSA topics, and this initiative aims to **bridge that gap** by providing **well-structured solutions, explanations, and best practices** in Swift.

## 🎯 Why This Repository?
Many iOS developers focus heavily on UI/UX and app development but often **struggle with algorithmic problem-solving** during technical interviews. The goal of this repository is to **help iOS engineers become confident in DSA** by:

- Providing **Swift-based solutions** for common DSA problems.
- Encouraging **daily problem-solving** for consistency.
- Helping iOS developers **develop a strong algorithmic mindset**.
- Offering **optimized and well-documented** code for better understanding.

## 📁 Repository Structure
This repository is structured to keep problems **organized and accessible**.

```
📂 iOS_DSA_Problems
